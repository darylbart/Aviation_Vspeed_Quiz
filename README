# Aviation V-Speed Quiz

## Overview
The Aviation V-Speed Quiz is a simple web application built using Flask that helps users learn and test their knowledge of V-speeds for different aircraft. Users can select an aircraft, answer questions about its V-speeds, and view all stored V-speeds for reference.

## Features
- Supports multiple aircraft (Sling2 and RV12)
- Randomly generates quiz questions based on selected aircraft
- Provides instant feedback on answers
- Displays all V-speeds for selected aircraft
- User-friendly and responsive UI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aviation-vspeed-quiz.git
   cd aviation-vspeed-quiz
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## How to Edit the Code
### Modifying V-Speeds
You can update the V-speeds in `app.py` under the `v_speeds` dictionary:
```python
v_speeds = {
    "Sling2": {
        "Vx": 65,
        "Vr": 55,
        "Vy": 75,
        "Vne": 160,
        "Vno": 129,
        "Vs": 48,
        "Vso": 40
    },
    "RV12": {
        "Vx": 60,
        "Vr": 50,
        "Vy": 70,
        "Vne": 140,
        "Vno": 120,
        "Vs": 45,
        "Vso": 37
    }
}
```

### Changing the UI
The `templates/quiz.html` file contains the HTML structure. You can edit styles and layout inside this file.
